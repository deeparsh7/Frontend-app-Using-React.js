**Functionalities:**

Tooltip Customization: Users have the flexibility to select the target element for the tooltip, set its position, customize its style (including text size, padding, color, background color, corner radius, width), and input the tooltip text.

Real-time Mobile Screen Preview: A mobile screen mockup is provided where button elements serve as potential target points for the tooltip. These buttons, once selected, will showcase the tooltip as customized by the user in real-time.

Pure CSS Positioning: This tooltip system is built without relying on any additional libraries, ensuring lightweight and efficient rendering.

**Project Structure:**

TooltipForm Component: This component contains the form elements allowing users to customize the tooltip's target, position, style, and text.

MobilePreview Component: This component displays a mobile screen preview with button elements. Tooltips are rendered on this component based on the specifications provided in the TooltipForm.
